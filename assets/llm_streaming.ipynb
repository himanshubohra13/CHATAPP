The area was once part of the ancient kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon. It was later ruled by the British as part of the United Provinces. During the Indian independence movement, many freedom fighters hailed from Uttarakhand. Post-independence, the region was divided between the states of Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. The demand for a separate state gained momentum in the late 20th century, leading to its formation.
